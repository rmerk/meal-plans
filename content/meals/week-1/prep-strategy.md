# Week 1: Prep Strategy

**Estimated time:** 2-3 hours total
**Yield:** 7 lunches + 7 dinners

## The Menu (14 Meals)

### Lunches (7 Total)
- **Beef & Broccoli Bowl** (4 servings)
- **Chicken Salad** (3 servings)

### Dinners (7 Total)
- **Beef Stir-Fry** (4 servings)
- **Pork & Soba** (3 servings)

## Order of Operations

Follow these 5 steps in order for the most efficient batch prep workflow. This systematic approach minimizes kitchen time and ensures everything stays organized.

### 1. Prep Carbs

Start the rice (2 cups dry) and cook soba noodles. Rinse noodles with cold water & oil.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Use a rice cooker on the "keep warm" setting while you prep everything else. For soba, rinse thoroughly with cold water to remove excess starch and prevent clumping.

---

### 2. Vegetables & Aromatics

Chop everything at once. Mince ~30 cloves garlic, grate ginger. Chop broccoli, cabbage, carrots, onions, bok choy.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Use a food processor for cabbage and carrots to save 15 minutes. Store prepped garlic and ginger in small bowls covered with plastic wrap to prevent drying out.

---

### 3. Mix Sauces

Make all 4 sauces in separate jars/bowls so they are ready to dump in pan.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Label each jar/bowl with the recipe name. Having sauces pre-mixed speeds up cooking dramatically and ensures consistent flavor across all portions.

---

### 4. Cook & Assemble

Cook one meal at a time. Portion immediately into containers. **Note:** Keep salad components separate.

**💡 Pro Tip:** For the Vietnamese chicken salad, use 3 separate containers per serving: vegetables, chicken, and dressing. This keeps everything crisp for the full week!

---

### 5. Cool & Store

Let hot meals cool 30-45 mins before lidding to prevent sogginess.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Place containers on a cooling rack for better air circulation. Once cool, stack in the fridge with oldest meals in front for easy "first in, first out" rotation.

## Essential Prep Tips

### ✅ Mise en Place
Have all ingredients measured and prepped before you start cooking. This makes the actual cooking process smooth and stress-free.

### ⏰ Time Management
While rice cooks and noodles boil, use that time to chop vegetables and mix sauces. Efficient multitasking cuts total time by 30-45 minutes.

### 📦 Container Organization
Use glass containers when possible - they reheat better and don't stain. Label each with the meal name and date for easy tracking.

### ⚠️ Food Safety
Never put hot food directly in the fridge - it raises the internal temperature. Always let meals cool to room temp first, then refrigerate within 2 hours.

## Time-Saving Strategies

- **Parallel Processing**: While carbs cook, chop all vegetables at once
- **Batch Sauce Prep**: Mix all sauces before cooking to avoid mid-cook interruptions
- **Tool Efficiency**: Food processor for shredding saves 15+ minutes
- **FIFO Storage**: Oldest meals in front for systematic consumption

## Storage Guidelines

- **Refrigeration**: Store cooked meals in airtight containers for up to 5-7 days
- **Cooling**: Allow 30-45 minutes cooling time before sealing containers
- **Labeling**: Mark each container with meal name and prep date
- **Separation**: Keep salad components separate to maintain freshness and texture
