# Week 2: Prep Strategy

**Estimated time:** 2-3 hours total
**Yield:** 7 lunches + 7 dinners

## The Menu (14 Meals)

### Lunches (7 Total)
- **Turkey "Bibimbap"** (4 servings)
- **Ginger-Garlic Chicken** (3 servings)

### Dinners (7 Total)
- **Crispy Tofu Stir-fry** (4 servings)
- **Pork & Green Bean** (3 servings)

## Order of Operations

Follow these 6 steps in order for the most efficient batch prep workflow. This week features Asian-inspired flavors with a focus on crispy tofu and flavorful sauces.

### 1. Prep Carbs

Cook **7 cups of dry brown rice**. This is your base for all 14 meals. Let it cool.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Use a rice cooker set to "keep warm" while you prep other ingredients. Brown rice takes longer than white rice, so start this first to stay on schedule.

---

### 2. Prep Tofu

Press, cube, and toss tofu with cornstarch. Pan-fry, bake, or air-fry until crispy. Set aside.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Press tofu for at least 30 minutes to remove excess moisture - this is the secret to crispy tofu! Toss with cornstarch just before cooking for maximum crispiness.

---

### 3. Veggies & Aromatics

Mince all garlic/ginger. Slice all green onions, peppers, etc. Blanch all green beans.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Blanch green beans for 2-3 minutes in boiling water, then shock in ice water. This preserves their bright green color and crisp-tender texture throughout the week.

---

### 4. Mix Sauces

Make all 4 sauces in separate, labeled jars so they are ready to go.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Gochujang-based sauces benefit from sitting for 15-30 minutes - the flavors meld and intensify. Mix these first while you prep other ingredients.

---

### 5. Cook & Assemble

Work one recipe at a time. Cook the protein, add veggies and sauce. Portion over 1 cup of rice per container.

**💡 Pro Tip:** For bibimbap bowls, keep components slightly separated in the container - rice on bottom, protein and veggies on top. This prevents sogginess and makes reheating more even.

---

### 6. Cool & Store

Let all hot meals cool 30-45 mins before lidding. Stack and refrigerate.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Place containers on a cooling rack for better air circulation. Once cool, stack in the fridge with oldest meals in front for easy "first in, first out" rotation.

## Essential Prep Tips

### ✅ Tofu Pressing
Remove excess moisture by pressing tofu for 30+ minutes. Use a tofu press or wrap in paper towels with a heavy pan on top.

### 🔥 High Heat Cooking
Asian stir-fries benefit from high heat. Preheat your pan until a drop of water sizzles immediately.

### 🥢 Mise en Place
Have all ingredients prepped, sauces mixed, and proteins ready before you start cooking. Stir-fries cook fast!

### 📦 Container Selection
Use containers with dividers for bibimbap bowls to keep components separated and fresh.

## Time-Saving Strategies

- **Rice Cooker Magic**: Start rice immediately and let it work while you prep everything else
- **Tofu Batch Cooking**: Cook all tofu at once in the oven or air fryer (more hands-off than pan-frying)
- **Blanching Efficiency**: Blanch all green beans together, then shock in ice water
- **Sauce Pre-Mixing**: All 4 sauces can be mixed and stored while other prep happens

## Storage Guidelines

- **Refrigeration**: Store cooked meals in airtight containers for up to 5-7 days
- **Tofu Texture**: Store crispy tofu separately if possible and add just before eating for best texture
- **Rice Storage**: Cooked brown rice stores well and reheats beautifully with a splash of water
- **Component Separation**: Keep bibimbap components slightly separated to maintain texture variety
