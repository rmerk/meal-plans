# Week 3: Prep Strategy

**Estimated time:** 2-3 hours total
**Yield:** 7 lunches + 7 dinners

## The Menu (14 Meals)

### Lunches (7 Total)
- **Chicken Green Curry** (4 servings)
- **"Mapo" Beef & Tofu** (3 servings)

### Dinners (7 Total)
- **Shrimp Teriyaki** (4 servings)
- **Gingery Tofu & Bok Choy** (3 servings)

## Order of Operations

Follow these 6 steps in order for the most efficient batch prep workflow. This week features diverse proteins including chicken, beef, shrimp, and tofu with bold curry and Asian-inspired flavors.

### 1. Prep Carbs

Cook **7 cups of dry brown rice**. This is your base for all 14 meals. Let it cool.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Brown rice pairs beautifully with curry and teriyaki sauces. Use a rice cooker set to "keep warm" while you prep other ingredients.

---

### 2. Veggies & Aromatics

Chop everything. Mince all garlic/ginger. Slice peppers, onions, mushrooms. Trim asparagus. Wash/halve bok choy.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Bok choy prep is quick - just trim the base, separate leaves, wash thoroughly, and halve lengthwise. Baby bok choy can be cooked whole after washing.

---

### 3. Prep Proteins

Cut chicken thighs. Press/cube extra-firm tofu. Drain/cube soft tofu.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Chicken thighs stay more tender than breasts for batch cooking. Press extra-firm tofu for stir-fries, but soft tofu for Mapo needs minimal handling to keep its silky texture.

---

### 4. Mix Sauces

Make the sauces for Mapo, Teriyaki, and Ginger Tofu in 3 separate jars.

**💡 Pro Tip:** The green curry uses curry paste directly in the pot, so you only need to pre-mix 3 sauces this week. Label each jar clearly!

---

### 5. Cook & Assemble

Work one recipe at a time. The Green Curry needs a large pot. The other 3 can be made in a wok/skillet.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Start with the green curry since it's a one-pot dish and can simmer while you prep your stir-fry station. Shrimp cooks fast (2-3 minutes per side), so have everything ready before the shrimp hits the pan.

---

### 6. Cool & Store

Let all 14 hot meals cool 30-45 mins before lidding.

**💡 Pro Tip:** Place containers on a cooling rack for better air circulation. Stack in the fridge with oldest meals in front for easy "first in, first out" rotation.

## Essential Prep Tips

### 🍛 Curry Cooking
Green curry benefits from simmering - let it cook low and slow for 15-20 minutes to develop deep flavor. Add coconut milk gradually to control thickness.

### 🦐 Shrimp Tips
Don't overcook shrimp! They're done when pink and opaque (2-3 minutes per side). Overcooked shrimp become rubbery.

### 🥢 Tofu Varieties
This week uses TWO types of tofu: extra-firm (press and cube) for stir-fries, and soft/silken (gentle cubing) for Mapo. Don't confuse them!

### 🥬 Bok Choy Storage
Store bok choy stems and leaves in the meal containers - they reheat beautifully and stay crisp-tender all week.

## Time-Saving Strategies

- **Curry First**: Green curry is mostly hands-off simmering time - start it first
- **Protein Variety**: Three different proteins this week means varied prep, but each cooks quickly
- **Mushroom Slicing**: Use an egg slicer for perfectly uniform mushroom slices in seconds
- **Sauce Efficiency**: Only 3 sauces to pre-mix (curry uses paste directly)

## Storage Guidelines

- **Refrigeration**: Store cooked meals in airtight containers for up to 5-7 days
- **Curry Storage**: Green curry stays vibrant and flavorful for 5-7 days refrigerated
- **Shrimp**: Best consumed within 3-4 days for optimal texture and freshness
- **Bok Choy**: Stores well in stir-fries - maintains texture throughout the week
- **Tofu Texture**: Soft tofu in Mapo will release some liquid during storage - this is normal
